  "description": "CRITICAL: The guided escalation feature (commit 3da36dc) has been successfully implemented and tested on branch agent/engineer/task-chain-pl, but has NOT been merged to the QA test branch (agent/qa/task-chain-ch).\n\n## Required Actions:\n1. Cherry-pick or merge commit 3da36dc to the QA test branch\n2. Resolve any merge conflicts if they occur\n3. Verify all tests still pass after merge\n4. Address style issues (optional but recommended):\n   - Refactor 11 lines exceeding 100 chars in escalation.py\n   - Remove 3 unnecessary f-strings in escalation.py\n   - Update deprecated datetime.utcnow() calls to datetime.now(datetime.UTC)\n\n## Implementation Details:\nCommit: 3da36dc\nBranch: agent/engineer/task-chain-pl\nFiles changed: 6 files (+878, -14 lines)\nTest coverage: 15/15 tests passing (100%)\nSecurity: 0 vulnerabilities\nCode quality: 8.73/10\n\nSee QA_REVIEW_GUIDED_ESCALATION.md for full review details.",
