  "description": "QA Review found that conditional workflow implementation exists on 'agent/engineer/task-chain-pl' branch but is not merged to the test branch. Additionally, there are type hint errors and test failures that need to be addressed.\n\nIssues to fix:\n1. CRITICAL: Merge commits 7bca481, 8a47658, d768d27, 34ef0c7 from agent/engineer/task-chain-pl\n2. MEDIUM: Fix type hints - change 'any' to 'Any' in dag.py lines 26, 53, 71\n3. MEDIUM: Ensure all unit tests pass after merge (10 currently failing)\n4. LOW: Remove unused imports (Path from conditions.py, Set from dag.py)\n5. LOW: Update agent fixture in tests to include WorkflowExecutor\n\nSee detailed findings in QA review.",
