  "title": "[ESCALATION] Wrong Feature Implemented: Conditional Workflows vs Interactive Checkpoints",
  "description": "CRITICAL REQUIREMENT MISMATCH:\n\nUser requested: Interactive checkpoints with configurable pause points and 'agent approve <task-id>' command for manual resume.\n\nEngineer delivered: Conditional workflow branches (DAG-based dynamic routing based on file patterns, PR size, test results).\n\nThese are completely different features. The delivered implementation is high quality but does not address the user's stated need for \"middle ground between fully autonomous and escalated modes.\"\n\nREFERENCE:\nAGENTIC_ROADMAP.md line 115-123 specifies:\n- Configurable pause points in workflows\n- agent approve <task-id> to resume\n- Checkpoint checking in _handle_successful_response()\n- approve command in CLI\n\nDECISION REQUIRED:\n1. Should we implement interactive checkpoints as originally requested?\n2. Should we keep conditional workflows and ADD checkpoints?\n3. Should we accept conditional workflows as delivered?\n\nThe conditional workflows implementation includes:\n- 715-line documentation (CONDITIONAL_WORKFLOWS.md)\n- 4 new Python modules (conditions.py, dag.py, executor.py)\n- Comprehensive test coverage\n- Security: PASSED (0 vulnerabilities)\n- Quality: 8.34/10 pylint score\n- Tests: 10 of 30 failing (need integration fix)\n\nPlease review QA_FINAL_REVIEW.md for full analysis and provide direction.",
